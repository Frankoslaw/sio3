This project is a reimplementation of the OIOIOI project which is a platform to perform informatics competition as a part of the SIO2 project. This project is meant only for educational purposes. Because of this reason, this project is overengineered to incorporate:
- docker
- amqp / RabbitMQ
- orm typeORM
- database mariadb / mongo DB
- kubernates for scalability
- axios for comunication between services

some of this technologies are steel missing because project is in early stage of development
